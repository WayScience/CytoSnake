Welcome to the testing documentation for `CytosSnake`, where you'll learn the essential principles of crafting effective and insightful tests.
Our tests focus on

In this documentation you will learn the mission of making effective tests in `CytoSnake` Ensuring that every user who uses `CytoSnake` has

## Rational and Motivation

Belo are the rationals and moitvations behind generating tests for `CytoSnake`

### Performance 

Remarkable technological advances have occurred within the field of high-throughput microscopy imaging, generating a surmount of single-cell morphology readouts, also known as single-cell morphology profiles. 
With this increase in data, there is a high need for high-performing software tools that can not only scale with large volumes of single-cell morphology profiles but also analyze the quickly.  
Our tests in `CytoSnake` are designed to align with our goals of scale and performance. By rigorously evaluating core functionality, we ensure that users can swiftly obtain conclusions from their data, enabling faster insights and analysis.

## Types of tests and focuses

## Best Practices

We believe that implementing good testing practices can create software that's not only robust but also significantly more dependable.
This ensures a high level of reliability for users and developers to conduct their analysis with confidence in `CytoSnake`.

Outlined below are the best practices that we consider instrumental in helping us achieve our objectives.

### Tech stack

Our testing suite uses [`pytest`] a very powerful and flexible testing

### Dataset

The datasets that we use are strucuted, emmulating

### Clear and Descriptive test

In `CytoSnake`, well-structured testing documentation plays an important role.
It simplifies the software experience for both users and developers by providing a clear understanding of what is being tested within `CytoSnake`.
We believe that providing easy-to-follow documentation generated complete t
